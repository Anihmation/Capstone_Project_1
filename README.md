## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Project Dataset collected is made up of 5 Workbooks titled: ‘Customers’, ‘Locations’, ‘Products’, ‘Sales Reps’ and finally ‘Sales’. The Customers workbook gives more detail to who a customer with 793entries under 3 columns; the Locations workbook gives more detail to the sales with 632 entries under 5 columns; the Products Workbook gives more detail to the Products with 1,894 entries under 4 columns; the Sales Reps Workbook gives detail to the Sales Reps with 14 entries under 4 columns and finally the Sales Workbook sums up the Sales with 9,994 entries under 12 columns.

Simply put, the Dataset is a Sales Report of this Superstore, that has operated in the whole of United States of America for 4 years.
I extracted, wrangled, and transformed the data to get it ready for the analysis. I used the Business Intelligence tool, Power BI to perform the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), Data Query and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Data Visualization.
